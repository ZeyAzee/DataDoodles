# Children’s Education and Conflict

This project explores the relationship between armed conflict and access to primary education.
Using international datasets on out-of-school children and armed conflicts, we analyze how
conflict status affects educational exclusion across countries and over time.

## Data pipeline
- Raw education and conflict datasets
- Merged dataset at country-year level
- Comparison charts (bars, heatmaps, waffle)
- Distribution analysis (histogram, boxplot, violin)
- Map dataset (Changemap, choropleth, proportional Symbols)
- Connection analysis (Sankey and network)

All visualizations are built from preprocessed CSV files generated in the notebooks folder.
